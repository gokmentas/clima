# Clima ☁

## My Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. I have looked at how to carry out time-consuming tasks such as getting device locations and networking to get data from the internet.

## What did I create

I have made a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). You can find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
